Report on AI Agents\n\nAI agents are a rapidly evolving field in the world of artificial intelligence. Based on the information provided in the multiple documents, here is a report on the current state of AI agents:\n\n1. Diverse Applications: AI agents are being developed for a wide range of applications, including general-purpose tasks, productivity, business intelligence, coding, data analysis, personal assistance, and more. The agents can be customized to take on specific personas or roles.\n\n2. LLM-Powered Capabilities: Many AI agents leverage large language models (LLMs) as their core technology. This allows them to understand natural language, generate text, and even execute code based on user prompts.\n\n3. Workflow Automation: Some AI agents are designed to automate workflows by generating dynamic plans and executing them, rather than just providing static responses.\n\n4. Tool Integration: Agents can be integrated with various tools and APIs, allowing them to perform tasks like web browsing, data processing, and software development.\n\n5. Autonomous Behavior: The goal of many AI agents is to become more autonomous, able to take actions and solve problems without constant human supervision.\n\n6. Challenges and Limitations: While AI agents are becoming more capable, they still face challenges in terms of reliability, error-handling, and the potential for unintended consequences when taking actions.\n\n7. Industry Adoption: Major tech companies like Google DeepMind are investing heavily in AI agent development, and startups are also emerging in this space, showcasing impressive demos and capabilities.

Tool use from anthropic
Alex Albert shared 5 architectures for using them in an agentic context:

Delegation: Use cheaper, faster models for cost and speed gains.
For example, Opus can delegate to Haiku to read a book and return relevant passages. This works well if the task description & result are more compact than the full context.
Parallelization: Cut latency (but not cost) by running agents in parallel.
e.g. 100 sub-agents each read a different chapter of a book, then return key passages.
Debate: Multiple agents with different roles engage in discussion to reach better decisions.
For example, a software engineer proposes code, a security engineer reviews it, a product manager gives a user's view, then a final agent synthesizes and decides.
Specialization: A generalist agent orchestrates, while specialists execute tasks.
For example, the main agent uses a specifically prompted (or fine-tuned) medical model for health queries or a legal model for legal questions.
Tool Suite Experts: When using 100s or 1000s of tools, specialize agents in tool subsets.
Each specialist (the same model, but with different tools) handles a specific toolset. The orchestrator then maps tasks to the right specialist (keeps the orchestrator prompt short).
