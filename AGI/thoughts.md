It is now May of 2024 and I definitly think we are seeing AGI emerge. We are now working with OpenAi GPT 4 Omni.
They recently demonstrated real time conversation with the model. You talk with it in a coversation. This is not available for use yet but should be coming. The demonstration was enabled because the model is natively working with the audio so that it is audio in and out without any translation going on back to words

Right now I use GPT 4 and Anthropic modesl. On usage right now (5/20/24) I use it for finacial anaysis, medical advice, research and a lot of summarization.
