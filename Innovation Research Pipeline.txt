Company Research Pipeline
Choose and then define question
Do background research on topic: identify and read articles. Begin to identify drivers or important ideas from reading
Set up interviews: Identify who to interview. Do background research on them.
Develop some standard and unique questions for them. 
Take notes on interviews and capture important ideas from interviews
Synthesize all that you have learned. Try to create an approach to the problem that you set up in the initial question
Now you should try to get the ideas tested
It would also be good to create a set of high level measures for this work.
If the test and measures show positive response you need to work toward some sort of business product: collaborative, seminar, white paper or individual consulting
