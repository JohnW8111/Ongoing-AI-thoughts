* **We are all following someone or something.** The sermon opens with a social experiment illustrating how easily people follow others, highlighting that we are constantly influenced and led.
* **To follow Jesus means to apprentice under him.** This requires more than just acknowledging him; it demands an active pursuit of knowing him deeply and becoming like him.

* **Apprenticeship involves learning, observing, and imitating.** Just as disciples learned by watching their rabbis, we are called to observe how Jesus interacted with others and strive to emulate his compassion, love, and patience. Jesus had called the disciples
* **Relational living is central to being like Jesus.** The sermon underscores the significance of demonstrating Christ's love through our interactions with others, recognizing that we might be the only "Bible" someone reads.

**Main Ideas:**

1. **Jesus desires a close, personal relationship with us, not just distant following.** He longs to walk side by side with us, offering guidance, love, and transformation.
