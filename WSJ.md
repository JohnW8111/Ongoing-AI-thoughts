“OF ALL the items on the menu,” runs the frequently repeated pronouncement from fin-
de-siècle French celebrity chef Auguste Escoffier, “soup is that which exacts the most
delicate perfection and the strictest attention.” I have never liked this quote but I have to
admit that it is completely true.
I’m not a fan of any food writing that makes cooking out to be more intimidating than it
has to be. But creating a spectacular soup does require strict attention, especially when it
comes to seasoning.
I make a lot of soup, and a lot of vegetable soup in particular. My wife is a vegetable
farmer; her CSA program has about 250 members. Each week, every member picks a
number of items, which they then receive in a box. The items include straight-up organic
vegetables, but also what we in the farming world call “value-added items.” We add value
to asparagus, for instance, by turning it into soup, sealed in pint containers that serve two
people. So any given week, I might be making soup for 500 people. Like I said, a lot of
soup.
In order to achieve a dependable level of consistency, I’ve had to formulate the soup
making. It’s a way of being exact while still maintaining the flexibility to work with
whatever my wife brings me that week.
The formula is straightforward, as formulas tend to be, but also allows for great variation.
Here it is:
2 tablespoons fat
½ pound onions, sliced
1 pound veggies, chopped
3 cups liquid
Seasonings: spice, acid, sweet, salt, umami
Cook.
Purée.
Season.
Garnish.
The above quantities serve 4-6 people and are infinitely multipliable.
The fat brings flavor and mouth-coating satisfaction, on top of its primary function as a
cooking medium. Butter and olive oil are obvious examples that I use all the time. Other
great choices: chicken schmaltz and rendered pork fat. Add whatever fat you choose to a
pot, and to that add the sliced onion.
The onion provides a lovely sweetness to balance the finished soup. The soup gets puréed
in the end, so the onion can simply be sliced; no need to take the additional step of
chopping. You can brown the onions, but you don’t have to. At least cook the raw flavor
out of them, by which point they should be translucent.
Now add your chopped vegetables. In the spring, it could be peas, asparagus, fennel or
escarole. Once summer comes around, zucchini, eggplant or peppers. Fall brings winter
squash, beets and potatoes. It doesn’t matter. Anything works. Just make sure it’s
trimmed and peeled, depending on the vegetable.
Then, in goes the liquid. Water works great. Stock is even better. (Why not build flavor at
every opportunity?) If, like me, you make your own ricotta, the leftover whey is an
incredible option here. Milk works, too. Along with the liquid, throw in a couple
teaspoons of salt, and bring everything to a boil. Cover the pot and cook until the
vegetables are tender. Depending on how thinly you cut them and which vegetable you
choose, that could be anywhere from 8 to 15 minutes.
In the spring, it could be peas, asparagus, fennel or escarole. It doesn’t matter. Anything
works.
So far, so easy. Just follow the formula. Now comes the delicate part: seasoning. Mostly, in
cooking, when we refer to seasoning we mean salting. Or maybe salting and peppering.
But really it means way more than that. It means creating a balance of salt, sweet, acid,
umami and, sometimes, bitter. Each variation of fat, vegetable and liquid requires its own
unique seasoning. It is seasoning that defines a cook. It requires a holistic imagining of
the dish. Taste the soup. Is it bright enough? If not, add acid. Maybe that means lemon
juice, or vinegar. Maybe pickle brine? Repeat that exercise for salt, bitter, sweet and
umami. Dig into your pantry for things like Parmesan, maple syrup, chile flakes, fish or
soy sauce, cumin, coriander, paprika. Each seasoning takes the soup in a different and
potentially wonderful direction.
Finally, purée everything in the blender until it’s smooth. And find a garnish. That could
mean chopped fresh herbs or crunchy fried bread crumbs. It could also be a dollop of
crème fraîche or a swirl of cream. No matter what you choose, make sure it brings a
contrast to the texture and flavor of the soup.
This is not complicated. Soup doesn’t have to be. But it is important to be exacting about
it. Stick to the formula and focus on the seasoning, and you’ll have a winner vegetable
soup every time.
