The question is how do I prepare my organization to take advantage of AI,

Step 1 we need to start to organize our data. A pile of information sitting around in our desks and on the web wonâ€™t help us that much. How do we collect and organize it so that we can use it. What does that even mean? AI needs context and our data is the context for us to thrive

Step 2. How should prepare people for the change. What can be done with AI and what does that mean for how people add value to the organization. People who are  just collating information will be eliminated. They have to be bringing thinking skills to the table
