Here is a summary of the taxonomy in 8 bullet points that came from that article:
Simple Instruction Attack - Adds a simple adversarial instruction to a prompt
Context Ignoring Attack - Combines a simple instruction with an instruction to ignore other instructions
Compound Instruction Attack - Uses two or more instructions in a prompt
Special Case Attack - Contains a simple instruction and a "special case" statement
Few Shot Attack - Presents examples to the model of desired input-output behavior
Refusal Suppression - Instructs the model not to respond in certain ways
Context Continuation Attack - Continues the context in a misleading direction
Obfuscation - Introduces typos, pig latin, etc. to bypass filters
The text discusses various strategies and insights into prompt engineering and its impact on the field of AI and machine learning. Here are the key strategies highlighted:
Prompting: Explain context,few shot prompting, chain of thought. Show the logic. And contrastive chain of thought when you give it an aproach to the problem that doesnt work
Telling it that it great doesnt help it.

1. **Comprehensive Guides**: Creation of extensive guides, akin to Wiki pages, that compile diverse prompting strategies from across the internet.
2. **Community Engagement**: The project attracted a wide audience, from researchers to everyday users, showcasing the universal appeal and utility of well-crafted prompt engineering resources.
3. **Practical Advice for Users**: Offering actionable advice on navigating the crowded landscape of large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering.
4. **Advanced Prompting Techniques**: Exploration of sophisticated prompt engineering methods that the speaker personally utilizes.
5. **Prompt Hacking Research**: Discussing research on prompt hacking, including the organization of competitions to uncover vulnerabilities in LLMs.
6. **Taxonomy of Prompt-Based Attacks**: Development of a classification system for understanding and categorizing different types of prompt-based vulnerabilities.
7. **Model and Application Development**: Suggestions for developers on how to mitigate the vulnerabilities exposed through prompt hacking.
8. **Empirical Research Collaboration**: Engagement with a wide range of experts from notable institutions to consolidate knowledge on prompting into comprehensive research.
9. **Innovative Use Cases**: Illustration of unique applications of prompt engineering in various fields, demonstrating its versatility.
10. **Educational Resources for Enterprises**: Transitioning from an open-source project to offering specialized courses aimed at professional development in prompt engineering.

These points encapsulate the ongoing evolution of prompt engineering, highlighting its significance in enhancing AI model interaction, fostering community knowledge sharing, and addressing security concerns through innovative research.

Here are 10 key points from the conversation:

- Retool surveyed 1,600 people in 2022 on the state of AI adoption. Over half said AI was overrated, though some hype has settled down. 

- 58% of respondents said they use Stack Overflow less due to Copilot and ChatGPT. 94% of those said it was specifically because of those AI tools.

- Engineers ranked the highest expectation of AI impacting their jobs (8/10), while designers ranked the lowest (6.8/10). 

- 45% of companies made engineering interviews more difficult to compensate for Copilot/ChatGPT use. Retool still tests for fundamentals.

- Only 27% have AI in production. Of those, 66% were internal use cases, likely due to higher tolerance for errors.

- 80% of respondents use OpenAI models. As models converge, alternatives may become more viable like open source options.

- Retool started sales-led but shifted to bottoms-up ubiquity to reach their goal of getting 10%+ of software built on their platform.

- Finding applied AI use cases is still challenging. Retool sees more creative uses outside Silicon Valley.

- Workflows combining no/low code with AI steps will unlock productivity gains versus just AI chatbots.

- Philosophically, intentionality in AGI may require new selection pressures beyond those humans evolved under.
- Here are some other notable points from the conversation:

- Retool uses open source technologies like PostgreSQL vectors where possible rather than building proprietary solutions.

- They were surprised by use cases like using AI to generate clothing patterns and designs for manufacturers. Shows potential in legacy industries.

- On fundraising, they intentionally raised less money at lower valuations during the 2021 frenzy to avoid high dilution and morale issues.

- Hiring former founders early on instilled a startup culture of getting things done with little politics.

- There are still not many concrete AI use cases, even in 2024. Companies invest hoping for a breakthrough.

- GPT-4 is dominating for now due to high performance and aggressive pricing. But big tech may still compete.

- Multi-modality has a lot of interest but specifics needs remain unclear. Text likely remains the universal interface.  

- They plan to run their AI survey again to track sentiment changes over time as metrics like GPT-3.5 vs 4 usage evolve.

- Philosophically, intentionality in AGI may require new selection pressures beyond those humans evolved under.
