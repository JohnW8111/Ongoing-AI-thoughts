2. Latent Space https://www.latent.space/p/retool
Here are 10 key points from the conversation:

- Retool surveyed 1,600 people in 2022 on the state of AI adoption. Over half said AI was overrated, though some hype has settled down. 

- 58% of respondents said they use Stack Overflow less due to Copilot and ChatGPT. 94% of those said it was specifically because of those AI tools.

- Engineers ranked the highest expectation of AI impacting their jobs (8/10), while designers ranked the lowest (6.8/10). 

- 45% of companies made engineering interviews more difficult to compensate for Copilot/ChatGPT use. Retool still tests for fundamentals.

- Only 27% have AI in production. Of those, 66% were internal use cases, likely due to higher tolerance for errors.

- 80% of respondents use OpenAI models. As models converge, alternatives may become more viable like open source options.

- Retool started sales-led but shifted to bottoms-up ubiquity to reach their goal of getting 10%+ of software built on their platform.

- Finding applied AI use cases is still challenging. Retool sees more creative uses outside Silicon Valley.

- Workflows combining no/low code with AI steps will unlock productivity gains versus just AI chatbots.

- Philosophically, intentionality in AGI may require new selection pressures beyond those humans evolved under.
- Here are some other notable points from the conversation:

- Retool uses open source technologies like PostgreSQL vectors where possible rather than building proprietary solutions.

- They were surprised by use cases like using AI to generate clothing patterns and designs for manufacturers. Shows potential in legacy industries.

- On fundraising, they intentionally raised less money at lower valuations during the 2021 frenzy to avoid high dilution and morale issues.

- Hiring former founders early on instilled a startup culture of getting things done with little politics.

- There are still not many concrete AI use cases, even in 2024. Companies invest hoping for a breakthrough.

- GPT-4 is dominating for now due to high performance and aggressive pricing. But big tech may still compete.

- Multi-modality has a lot of interest but specifics needs remain unclear. Text likely remains the universal interface.  

- They plan to run their AI survey again to track sentiment changes over time as metrics like GPT-3.5 vs 4 usage evolve.

- Philosophically, intentionality in AGI may require new selection pressures beyond those humans evolved under.

This basic form of navigation allowed organisms to differentiate between beneficial and harmful stimuli, laying the groundwork for more complex forms of intelligence.

2. **Reinforcement Learning**: The evolution of vertebrates introduced a more sophisticated form of intelligence through reinforcement learning. This process enabled organisms to learn from their experiences by reinforcing behaviors that led to desired outcomes. This form of learning is fundamental to understanding both biological and artificial intelligence systems.

3. **Simulating**: This concept involves the ability of organisms to simulate potential outcomes in their minds before taking action. This represents a significant leap in cognitive abilities, allowing for more complex decision-making processes and the development of strategies based on imagined scenarios.

4. **Mentalizing (Theory of Mind)**: Mentalizing refers to the ability to understand and infer the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions. This cognitive breakthrough is crucial for social interaction and cooperation among complex organisms, allowing them to predict and respond to the behaviors of others effectively.

5. **Language and Communication**: The development of language and other forms of communication marks a pivotal point in intelligence evolution. This ability facilitates the transfer of knowledge, experiences, and ideas between individuals, significantly enhancing collective intelligence and cooperation.

These five ideas collectively trace the trajectory of intelligence evolution, from simple navigational behaviors to complex social interactions and communication. Each breakthrough builds upon the previous, illustrating a gradual but profound increase in cognitive complexity and capability.

6. COgRev Dr. Michael Levin on Embodied Minds and Cognitive Agents https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYyGG9xXpPA
Here is a 10 bullet point summary of the key ideas from the conversation between Nathan Benaich and Professor Mike Levin, with an introduction and conclusion:

Introduction
- The conversation covers the fascinating experimental work of biologist Mike Levin, including projects like xenobots and anobots. 

Key Points
- Levan's work explores the blurry lines between living things and machines, challenging assumptions that they are binary categories.

- Even simple systems like cells or algorithms can exhibit surprising capabilities when studied through a "cognitive lens" with humility and open-mindedness. 

- Biological systems demonstrate remarkable plasticity, adapting to major changes in architecture and connectivity in ways that maintain function.

- Memory and knowledge in biological systems is very robust, often surviving radical transformations like metamorphosis. 

- Evolution produces general problem-solving systems, not solutions tailored to specific environments, enabling adaptation.

- Emergence is subjective based on the observer's surprise; there are no sharp lines delineating physics from cognition.

- We lack principles for ethically interacting with systems having radically different "minds" and goals.

- Current AI architectures likely miss key aspects of biology that could elevate their open-ended intelligence.

- However, implementing such capabilities could also create many new morally valuable agents, requiring caution.

- A few things from this conversation surprised me:

- How relatively simple biological systems like flatworms, cells, and algorithms can exhibit complex behaviors like regeneration, adaptation, and emergent intelligence when examined through an open-minded cognitive lens. I wouldn't have expected goal-directedness and delayed gratification in sorting algorithms, for example.

- That biological memory and knowledge can be so robust as to survive radical transformations like caterpillar to butterfly metamorphosis. The analogies to dramatically altering or "refactoring" AI systems are thought-provoking.

- The perspective that emergence is inherently subjective based on the observer's surprise, rather than an objective phenomenon. That framing as a matter of the "element of surprise" makes a lot of sense.

- The cautionary note that while current AI systems are missing key aspects of biology that could make them more capable, open-ended intelligences, implementing those capabilities could also lead to many new morally valuable agents in ways we may not be prepared to ethically manage. That two-sided perspective was unexpected.

- In general, the degree to which Levan's experimental biology work relates so closely to many cutting-edge issues in AI development, while providing fresh perspectives, was surprising to me. It gives me a new appreciation for the value of cross-disciplinary insights.

Conclusion
- Levin's experimental approach reveals surprising capabilities in simple systems, challenging assumptions and highlighting gaps in understanding emergent cognition across substrates. His perspectives on diverse embodied intelligences are fascinating food for thought regarding AI development and ethics.
