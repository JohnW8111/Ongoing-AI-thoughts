The text discusses various strategies and insights into prompt engineering and its impact on the field of AI and machine learning. Here are the key strategies highlighted:
Prompting: Explain context,few shot prompting, chain of thought. Show the logic. And contrastive chain of thought when you give it an aproach to the problem that doesnt work
Telling it that it great doesnt help it.

1. **Comprehensive Guides**: Creation of extensive guides, akin to Wiki pages, that compile diverse prompting strategies from across the internet.
2. **Community Engagement**: The project attracted a wide audience, from researchers to everyday users, showcasing the universal appeal and utility of well-crafted prompt engineering resources.
3. **Practical Advice for Users**: Offering actionable advice on navigating the crowded landscape of large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering.
4. **Advanced Prompting Techniques**: Exploration of sophisticated prompt engineering methods that the speaker personally utilizes.
5. **Prompt Hacking Research**: Discussing research on prompt hacking, including the organization of competitions to uncover vulnerabilities in LLMs.
6. **Taxonomy of Prompt-Based Attacks**: Development of a classification system for understanding and categorizing different types of prompt-based vulnerabilities.
7. **Model and Application Development**: Suggestions for developers on how to mitigate the vulnerabilities exposed through prompt hacking.
8. **Empirical Research Collaboration**: Engagement with a wide range of experts from notable institutions to consolidate knowledge on prompting into comprehensive research.
9. **Innovative Use Cases**: Illustration of unique applications of prompt engineering in various fields, demonstrating its versatility.
10. **Educational Resources for Enterprises**: Transitioning from an open-source project to offering specialized courses aimed at professional development in prompt engineering.

These points encapsulate the ongoing evolution of prompt engineering, highlighting its significance in enhancing AI model interaction, fostering community knowledge sharing, and addressing security concerns through innovative research.
