**AI Outline May 2024** 

1. **Current State of AI**
   - AI matches expert performance in routine tasks with instances of success in specialized exams (MMLU, medical licensing, coding for example).
   - Limitations in AI's capacity for original thought and breakthrough insights, with occasional exceptions like creating reward functions for robots.

2. **AI vs. Human Intelligence**
   - **Breadth and Depth**: AI’s broad knowledge contrasted with human’s deep, nuanced understanding.
   - **Innovation**: Humans maintain the upper hand in creativity and insight generation.
   - **Efficiency**: AI excels in speed, cost, and availability.
   - **Interactions**: AI's advantage in interactions includes empathy, no inappropriate responses, and infinite patience.
   - **Adaptability**: Human superiority in dynamic environments vs. AI’s fragility under adversarial conditions.
   - **Memory**: Humans currently manage state more effectively.

3. **Capabilities of AI** some of these ideas are adapted from Azeem Azhar 
   - **Assistant Functions**: Automating routine tasks like coding, document analysis, email drafting, and translation.
   - **Creative Exploration**: Brainstorming, exploring scenarios, and constructive criticism.
   - **Research and Analysis**: Finding patterns, automating research, analyzing customer feedback, and making sense of the news.
   - **Communication and Presentation**: Enhancing communication, optimizing emails, posts, articles, and building presentation outlines.
   - **Planning and Strategy**: Planning and analysis, preparing for board meetings, and building strategy.
   - **Operational Efficiency**: Hiring, exploring assumptions.
   - **Intelligence and Insights**: Finding relationships and enhancing collective intelligence.

4. **Interfacing with AI: Modes of Engagement**
   - **Co-pilot Mode**: Interactive real-time collaboration, accessible for non-programmers.
   - **Delegation Mode**: Systematizing task execution for consistent AI performance, suitable for defined problems through algorithms involving multiple AI model calls.
   - **Agent Mode**: AI performs multi-step tasks independently, with potential future advancements.

5. **Mastering Co-pilot Mode: Effective Prompting and Tool Usage**
   - Crafting clear, accurate, and unambiguous instructions.
   - Providing examples of desired outcomes.
   - Specifying roles or styles for AI responses.
   - Utilizing formatting and templates.
   - Leveraging tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Codium.
   - Remaining vigilant about potential hallucinations and errors.

6. **Delegation Mode: Automating Existing Processes**
   - Understanding the implicit nature of many business processes.
   - Mapping out processes to identify inputs, outputs, and logic flow.
   - "Prompt before App" principle: Testing AI capabilities on specific tasks before full automation.
   - Leveraging no-code platforms and tools like Zapier for integration and automation.
   - Emphasizing the strategic importance of AI task automation skills in the current job market.

9. **Evaluating AI Performance: Ensuring Accuracy and Reliability**
   - Establishing benchmarks and evaluation criteria for AI outputs.
   - Monitoring for potential errors or unwanted behaviors.
   - Utilizing tools like Claude for Sheets to quantify AI performance.
   - Emphasizing the importance of evaluations in building trust and transparency with AI systems.

9. **Leadership in AI Integration**
   - Cultivating AI expertise within organizations.
   - Educating on AI’s potential and limitations while promoting strategic integration.
   - Advocating for an AI-centric culture: "Done for you beats Do-it-yourself," "Think AI first," and "AI should enhance, not replace."

9. **Commitment to Continuous AI Learning**
   - Latent Space is the best podcast if you are a developer https://www.latent.space 
   - Cognitive Revolution is good if you just want to understand what is going on https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai
   - If you want to get into a lot more detail about this here is a good site to start with (https://github.com/swyxio/ai-notes?tab=readme-ov-file)
