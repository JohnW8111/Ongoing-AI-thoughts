Levels of AGI: Operationalizing Progress on the Path to AGI Google DeepMind January 2024 https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02462

First is describes 6 principles to consider
1. Focus on Capabilities, not Processes. -focus on what an AGI can accomplish, not on the mechanism by which it accomplishes tasks.
2. Focus on Generality and Performance. 
3. Focus on Cognitive and Metacognitive Tasks. (Donâ€™t worry about robotics at this moment)
4. Focus on Potential, not Deployment. 
5. Focus on Ecological Validity. Tasks that can be used to benchmark progress toward AGI are critical to operationalizing any proposed definition. 
6. Focus on the Path to AGI, not a Single Endpoint. 

NextLevels of AGI
Level 0: No AI Narrow Non-AI
Level 1: Emerging:equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human (this is where we are with openAI in the broad range of things)
Level 2: Competent:at least 50th percentile of skilled adults
Level 3: Expert:at least 90th percentile of skilled adults
Level 4: Virtuoso: at least 99th percentile of skilled adults
Level 5: Superhuman:outperforms 100% of humans ( this is where we are in the narrow ranges of things with alpha fold )

And lastly as AI improves humans use it differently 
Autonomy Level 0: No A Ihuman does every- thing
Autonomy Level 2: AI as a Consultant AI takes on a substantive role, but only when invoked by a human
Autonomy Level 3: AI as a Collaborator co-equal human-AI collaboration; inter- active coordination of goals & tasks
Autonomy Level 4: AI as an ExpertAI drives interaction; human provides guidance & feedback or performs subtasks
Autonomy Level 5: AI as an Agent fully autonomous AI
