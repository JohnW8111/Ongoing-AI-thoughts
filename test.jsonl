This concept, developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), represents a transformational aim for health care systems.

The aim of this initiative is multifaceted and transformational in nature: 1. Exploration and Development: IHI seeks to explore and develop a variety of models to identify different ways of achieving transformational results that balance the best possible performance in health, patient experience, and per capita costs of care. 2. Identification of High-Performing Systems: More specifically, we seek to identify systems in the US that achieve the top deciles on measures of patient experience, health of a population, and per capita cost. 3. Cost Control: An additional focus is on systems that have controlled inflation in cost to less than 3% per year. 4. Balancing Act: The overarching goal is to find the optimal balance—or 'sweet spot'—where all three dimensions of the Triple Aim are maximized simultaneously. 5. Paradigm Shift: By pursuing these goals, IHI aims to catalyze a shift from the traditional acute care model to a more comprehensive, population-focused approach to health care delivery. This initiative recognizes the complex, interconnected nature of healthcare challenges and seeks to drive systemic change that addresses these challenges holistically, rather than piecemeal.
