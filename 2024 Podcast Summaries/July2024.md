Hosted by Alessio (partner and CTO-in-Residence at Decibel Partners) and Swyx (founder of Smol AI), the discussion delves deep into the intricacies of evaluating large language models (LLMs), the challenges in creating and maintaining benchmarks, and the future of AI model assessment.

## Key Points

1. **OpenLLM Leaderboard**: Clémentine Fourrier maintains the OpenLLM leaderboard at Hugging Face, which has evaluated over 7,400 models. The leaderboard serves as a crucial resource for the AI community, allowing fair comparisons between models and cutting through marketing claims. Fourrier states, "We basically expect the scale of AI progress to go so fast that anyway, we will have to renew them [benchmarks]."

2. **Evaluation Challenges**: The podcast highlights the complexities in evaluating LLMs, including the need for fair and reproducible benchmarks. Fourrier emphasizes the importance of automated benchmarks for their reproducibility, stating, "Automated benchmarks, like the one we're using on the OpenLLM leaderboard, are usually fair and reproducible. Every model gets evaluated in exactly the same way, and you can really reproduce the scores you get."

3. **Human vs. Automated Evaluation**: The discussion covers the pros and cons of human evaluation versus automated benchmarks. Fourrier expresses concerns about human evaluations, particularly "vibe check" evaluations and RNA-type systems, due to potential biases and lack of reproducibility. She notes, "RNAs are not giving you factuality, which should be a super important aspect of LLMs, I think."

4. **Benchmark Selection**: The podcast delves into the process of selecting benchmarks for the OpenLLM leaderboard. Fourrier explains their criteria, including relevance, stability, and community perception. She mentions, "We spent, I'd say, about a month just running the evaluations on a wide variety of models to make sure that the implementations were absolutely correct and fair for all models."

5. **Compute Constraints**: An interesting aspect discussed is the computational resources required for model evaluation. Fourrier reveals, "If we evaluate a 7b model at the moment, it takes approximately two hours. If we evaluate a 70b at the moment, it takes around 20 hours." This highlights the significant computational demands of thorough model evaluation.

6. **Emerging Benchmarks**: The conversation covers new and interesting benchmarks, including GPQA (described as "Basically MMLU, but PhD level") and MUSR (multi-step soft reasoning). Fourrier expresses excitement about benchmarks that models currently struggle with, as they provide room for improvement.

7. **Long Context Evaluation**: The podcast addresses the growing importance of evaluating models on long-context tasks. Fourrier mentions benchmarks like MUSR and a dataset for "learning to translate a new language from one grammar book" as interesting approaches to long-context evaluation.

8. **Agent Benchmarks**: Discussing the evaluation of AI agents, Fourrier highlights the GAIA benchmark she worked on, which tests models in real-world scenarios rather than boxed environments. She expresses hope for more datasets like GAIA, stating, "I really think that anyone could contribute or create similar datasets."

9. **Model Calibration**: Fourrier identifies model calibration as an under-evaluated aspect of LLMs. She explains, "Basically, a model is said to be well calibrated if the log probability score of an answer correlates well with how correct the answer is." She suggests this could lead to models with confidence intervals for their answers.

10. **Future of Evaluation**: Looking ahead, Fourrier mentions working on the next version of the leaderboard. She predicts continued focus on reasoning and math evaluations, exploration of long-context tasks, and possibly the inclusion of code evaluation and psychofancy (how models can be problematic in their interactions) assessments.

## Concise Summary

## Introduction

This podcast features an in-depth discussion between Rob Wiblin and Carl Shulman on the potential economic and societal impacts of advanced artificial intelligence (AI). Carl Shulman, an independent researcher known for his influential work on existential risks, shares his vision of a future where AI systems become capable of performing all human tasks, leading to rapid economic growth and societal transformation. The conversation explores the mechanics of this transition, potential challenges, and ethical considerations surrounding AI development. This episode, part one of a two-part series, focuses primarily on AI's impact on the economy, international conflicts, and the moral status of AI minds.

## Key Points

1. **Rapid Economic Growth Potential**

Carl Shulman argues that once AI systems become capable of performing all human tasks, economic growth rates could increase dramatically. He suggests that the economy could potentially double every couple of months, rather than the current rate of about 5% per year. This acceleration is based on the idea that AI systems could work continuously without rest, rapidly replicate themselves, and operate at much higher efficiency than humans.

"If you do 8,760 hours of the year, 100% employment, at $100 per hour, you're getting close to a million dollars of wages equivalent."

2. **Energy and Resource Utilization**

Shulman discusses the potential for vastly increased energy utilization in an AI-driven economy. He argues that we could potentially harness a much larger portion of the solar energy hitting Earth, leading to enormous increases in available energy per person. This increased energy availability could support a massive expansion of AI "cognitive labor."

"That budget means you could have, per person, an energy budget that can, at any given time, sustain 50,000 human brain equivalents of AI cognitive labour, 10,000 human-scale robots."

3. **Geopolitical Implications**

The conversation explores how rapid AI-driven growth could reshape global power dynamics. Shulman suggests that countries or blocs that develop advanced AI first could gain a decisive strategic advantage, potentially leading to instability or conflicts. He emphasizes the need for international cooperation and agreements to manage this transition safely.

"Even after every state has access to the latest AI technology, a gap in natural resources can remain indefinitely, because right now those sorts of natural resources are too expensive to acquire."

4. **Physical Transformation of the Environment**

Shulman addresses concerns about the physical feasibility of such rapid growth, acknowledging that it would require massive changes to our environment. He argues that the potential economic gains would likely overcome current regulatory and NIMBY-style obstacles to large-scale construction and resource utilization.

5. **AI Capabilities and Human Labor**

The podcast discusses how AI systems could eventually match or exceed human capabilities across all domains. Shulman argues that this would lead to a situation where human labor becomes economically irrelevant, as AI systems could perform all tasks more efficiently and at a lower cost.

"Right now governments redistribute a significant percentage of all of the output in their territories, and we're talking about an expansion of economic output of orders of magnitude."

6. **Income Distribution in an AI-Driven Economy**

Shulman explores potential scenarios for income distribution in a world where AI has made human labor obsolete. He suggests that existing mechanisms of wealth redistribution, if maintained, could ensure a high standard of living for humans even as AI systems dominate the economy.

7. **Moral Status of AI Systems**

The conversation delves into the ethical considerations of creating advanced AI systems. Shulman argues for the importance of considering the potential moral status of AI minds, especially as they become increasingly sophisticated and humanlike in their capabilities.

"It seems pretty likely to me that there will be vast numbers of AIs that are smarter than us, that have desires, that would prefer things in the world to be one way rather than another, and many of which could be said to have welfare."

8. **Challenges in Assessing AI Consciousness**

Shulman discusses the difficulties in determining whether current AI systems have genuine experiences or consciousness. He emphasizes the need for continued research into AI interpretability and suggests that as AI systems become more advanced, these questions will become increasingly pressing.

9. **Coexistence of Humans and AI**

The podcast explores potential scenarios for a future where humans and AI systems coexist. Shulman discusses the challenges of maintaining human relevance and wellbeing in a world where AI systems are vastly more capable, and suggests potential institutional arrangements to ensure human interests are protected.

10. **Need for Proactive Planning and Governance**

Throughout the conversation, Shulman emphasizes the importance of proactive planning and governance to manage the transition to an AI-driven economy. He argues for the development of international agreements, institutional mechanisms, and technological safeguards to ensure that the benefits of AI are broadly shared and potential risks are mitigated.

"The amount of time that we have for human input into that transition is significantly affected by how fast these feedback processes are."

## Concise Summary

This podcast featuring Carl Shulman presents a vision of a future dramatically transformed by advanced artificial intelligence. Shulman argues that once AI systems become capable of performing all human tasks, we could see unprecedented economic growth rates, with the global economy potentially doubling every few months. This rapid growth would be driven by AI systems that can work continuously, replicate quickly, and utilize energy and resources far more efficiently than humans.

The conversation explores the wide-ranging implications of this scenario, from geopolitical power shifts to challenges in wealth distribution and the moral status of AI minds. Shulman emphasizes the need for proactive planning and international cooperation to manage this transition safely and equitably. He also delves into the ethical considerations of creating advanced AI systems, arguing for the importance of considering their potential moral status and welfare.

Throughout the discussion, Shulman presents a nuanced view that acknowledges both the enormous potential benefits of advanced AI and the significant challenges and risks it could pose. The podcast underscores the critical importance of thoughtful governance and foresight in shaping the development of AI technologies to ensure they benefit humanity as a whole.

# AI Advisors and Epistemic Revolution: A Conversation with Carl Shulman

## Introduction

This podcast features an in-depth conversation between Rob Wiblin and Carl Shulman, a polymath researcher known for his influential visions of how superhuman AI might play out. The discussion focuses on the potential impact of AI on government, politics, and decision-making after the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Shulman explores how trustworthy superhuman AI advisors could revolutionize governance, the potential for AI to help solve intractable philosophical questions, and the risks and opportunities associated with the rapid advancement of AI technology. This conversation is part of a series, building on previous discussions about the economic and national security implications of AGI.

## Key Points

1. **AI Advisors in Governance**

   Shulman envisions a future where AI advisors could significantly improve policy-making and governance. He argues that AI could provide unbiased, data-driven advice on complex issues, potentially avoiding mistakes made during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, AI advisors could have helped identify the severity of the outbreak earlier, guided more effective containment strategies, and optimized vaccine development and distribution. Shulman states, "If you have the AI advisors, and they are telling you, 'Look, this stuff is going to happen; you're going to regret it.' The AI advisor is credible. It helps navigate between politicians not fully understanding the economics and politics."

2. **Epistemic Revolution through AI**

   The podcast discusses how AI could lead to an "epistemic revolution" by providing more accurate and unbiased information across various fields. Shulman suggests that AI could help resolve long-standing debates in areas like social science, philosophy, and politics by offering more objective analyses. He explains, "You could see how that could distort things even within the regime. So the Soviet Union collapsed because Gorbachev rose to the top of the system while thinking it was terrible in many ways." This implies that better information and decision-making tools could have profound effects on political systems and ideologies.

3. **Challenges in Trusting AI Advisors**

   Despite the potential benefits, Shulman acknowledges the challenges in getting different parties, especially adversarial ones, to trust the same AI advisor. He discusses the need for transparency in AI development and the importance of having representation from different factions in the creation or auditing of these models. Shulman notes, "For example, Elon Musk, with his Grok AI: the claim is that that is going to be more honest AI and have different political biases than other chatbots... that might be a situation where it makes a big difference whether conservative or Republican legislators or voters in the United States have an AI model that they can to a greater extent trust was not made by their political opponents."

4. **AI in Military and Security**

   The conversation touches on the critical importance of how AI is integrated into military and security services. Shulman emphasizes the need for robust principles and motivations to be embedded in AI systems to prevent misuse or coups. He states, "If you're deploying these powerful AI systems at scale, they're having an enormous amount of influence and power in society — eventually to the point where ultimately the instruments of state hinge on their loyalties — then you really don't want to have this kind of backdoor or password, because it could actually overthrow the government, potentially."

5. **AI and Philosophical Progress**

   Shulman suggests that AI could potentially make more progress in philosophy and other abstract fields than in areas where humans have already made significant advancements. He argues that AI's ability to process vast amounts of information and apply consistent reasoning could lead to breakthroughs in long-standing philosophical debates. Shulman explains, "I think we should separate two things. One is how much absolute progress in knowledge can we generate? And there's some sense in which in the physical sciences we're really great at getting definitive knowledge, and adding in a tonne of research capacity from AI will make that quite a bit better."

6. **AI in Forecasting and Decision-Making**

   The podcast explores how AI could revolutionize forecasting and decision-making. Shulman discusses the potential for AI to provide more accurate predictions about future events, which could significantly impact policy-making and business strategies. He notes, "Creating AIs to forecast economic and political events is something that obviously has huge economic value, by providing signals for financial trading. There is huge social value potentially to be provided by predicting the political consequences and economic consequences of different policies."

7. **Risks of AI Misuse in Ideological Entrenchment**

   Shulman expresses concern about the potential misuse of AI to entrench existing ideologies or beliefs. He discusses the possibility of people using AI to create echo chambers or reinforce their existing worldviews. However, he remains optimistic that the overall effect of AI on society's epistemology will be positive. Shulman states, "My actual best guess is that the result of these technologies comes out hugely in favour of improved epistemology, and we get largely convergence on empirical truth wherever it exists."

8. **International Cooperation on AI Development**

   The conversation touches on the importance of international cooperation in AI development and regulation. Shulman emphasizes the need for agreements between major powers to ensure safe and responsible AI advancement. He suggests that unilateral actions, such as voluntary pauses in AI research, could be counterproductive if they shift relative influence to less cautious actors. Shulman argues, "It seems this would be reducing the slack and intensifying the degree to which international competition might otherwise be close, which might make it more likely that things like safety get compromised a lot."

9. **AI and Societal Values**

   Shulman discusses how AI could influence societal values and potentially help resolve long-standing moral and ethical debates. He suggests that AI's ability to process vast amounts of information and apply consistent reasoning could lead to more objective assessments of ethical issues. However, he also acknowledges the risks of AI being used to reinforce existing biases or ideologies. Shulman notes, "Inevitably, based on history, that will lead to many oxen being gored, and no political or philosophical or religious system or ideology will come out unscathed."

10. **The Future of AI and Human Society**

    In concluding the discussion, Shulman expresses a cautiously optimistic view of the future with AI. While acknowledging the potential risks and challenges, he believes that the overall impact of AI on society could be positive. Shulman states, "My median expectation, I think it's more likely than not that things wind up looking quite good, that we avoid a disaster that kills off humanity, and that probably we don't get a permanent global totalitarianism or something like that." However, he emphasizes the importance of continued efforts to ensure AI development is safe and beneficial to humanity.

## Concise Summary

This podcast explores the potential impact of advanced AI on governance, decision-making, and society at large. Carl Shulman envisions a future where AI advisors could revolutionize policy-making by providing unbiased, data-driven advice on complex issues. He argues that this could lead to an "epistemic revolution," improving our ability to address challenges in various fields, from public health to philosophy. However, Shulman also acknowledges the challenges in implementing such systems, including issues of trust, potential misuse, and the need for international cooperation. The discussion touches on the integration of AI into military and security services, emphasizing the critical importance of embedding robust principles to prevent misuse. Shulman expresses cautious optimism about the future, suggesting that while there are risks associated with AI development, the overall impact could be positive if managed properly. Throughout the conversation, he stresses the need for continued efforts to ensure AI development is safe and beneficial to humanity, highlighting the potential for AI to not only solve practical problems but also to help us address fundamental questions about ethics, values, and the nature of reality.

# 5 Cognitive Revolution Podcast:  The State Space Model Revolution, with Albert Gu

## Introduction

This episode of the Cognitive Revolution podcast features an in-depth conversation with Albert Gu, assistant professor at CMU and co-founder of Caresia AI. The main topic is Gu's groundbreaking work on state space models (SSMs) and the Mamba architecture. Host Nathan Labenz explores the intellectual history, technical details, and potential future directions of SSMs. The discussion provides valuable insights into the development of Mamba, its advantages over traditional transformer models, and its implications for the future of AI. This conversation is particularly relevant for those interested in the cutting edge of AI architecture design and the ongoing evolution of language models.

## Key Points

1. **Origins and Motivation of State Space Models**

   Albert Gu's work on state space models (SSMs) began several years ago, inspired by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). He was compelled by the idea of stateful recurrence as a fundamental computational paradigm for modeling sequences. This intuition led to the development of various models, including HIPPO (High-Order Polynomial Projection Operators) and S4 (Structured State Space Sequence Model). Gu emphasizes the importance of compressing context or information into a state, which he believes is crucial for intelligent processing of sequential data.

   > "The idea of compressing context or information into a state is somehow feels important because it's like stripping out unnecessary stuff."

2. **The Mamba Breakthrough**

   The Mamba architecture represents a significant advancement in SSMs. Its key innovation is the introduction of a selection mechanism that allows the model to dynamically adjust how it processes input based on the input itself. This enables the model to focus on important information and ignore irrelevant data, such as filler words in language. The selection mechanism is similar to gating in RNNs but implemented more efficiently.

   > "The idea is like if you have a sequence of tokens there will often be filler tokens or irrelevant tokens in it... The fact that it is taking up a time step is really kind of arbitrary and the idea that we wanted was to be able to skip over time steps if necessary."

3. **State Management in Mamba**

   Gu clarifies that each layer in the Mamba architecture has its own independent state. The state is a fixed-size vector that summarizes everything the model has seen so far. During training, the state doesn't need to be fully materialized due to clever algorithmic techniques. At inference time, the state must be materialized and stored between time steps. The size of the state is a controllable hyperparameter, offering a trade-off between efficiency and performance.

   > "The state is what the model needs to store in memory in between one token to the next token... It really encapsulates the nature of these different types of models."

4. **Mamba 2: Improvements and Trade-offs**

   Mamba 2 introduces changes that make the model more efficient on modern hardware, particularly by leveraging matrix multiplications. This comes at the cost of slightly reduced expressivity in the state update mechanism. However, this trade-off allows for larger state sizes and faster training. Gu notes that the impact of this reduced expressivity is not fully understood and may even provide beneficial inductive bias in some cases.

   > "We were trying to figure out if there was a compromise that could let us keep the spirit of Mamba in these SSMs but find like other algorithmic innovations that could let us leverage matrix multiplications and speed it and like leverage the tensor cores on GPUs."

5. **Comparison with Transformers**

   Gu discusses the fundamental differences between SSMs like Mamba and transformer models. While transformers use attention mechanisms and key-value caches to process all previous tokens, SSMs use a fixed-size state to compress and summarize the history. This leads to different trade-offs in terms of memory usage, computation, and the ability to handle long-range dependencies.

   > "The highest level description of the tradeoff between these things is that the SSM has a fixed size state that has been designed to try to intelligently compress history into a form that is easy for the model to extract new information from."

6. **Applications and Downstream Work**

   The podcast highlights the extensive adoption of Mamba in various fields. Over 267 papers and projects have been derived from Mamba, with applications ranging from language processing to vision, genomics, and time series analysis. Gu notes that SSMs like Mamba seem to perform particularly well on tasks with less structured data or where there hasn't been as much co-evolution with transformer models.

   > "Anywhere you see sequences I think it is kind of a natural choice. I don't think it's always the best choice... but that's hopefully what people have been finding in these follow-up applications."

7. **State Optimization and Creative Uses**

   Gu discusses potential creative uses of the state in SSMs. Unlike the key-value cache in transformers, the SSM state is a more compact and potentially interpretable representation of the input history. This opens up possibilities for tasks like style transfer, speaker encoding, or fine-tuning models by optimizing the initial state rather than the model weights.

   > "You can maybe interpolate things to blend between voices or blend between image styles and stuff like that... I think there's probably so many creative ideas that people can do to leverage the states of these models."

8. **Long Context and Infinite Attention**

   The conversation touches on the potential of SSMs to handle very long contexts. While current models can extrapolate to about 3 times their training context length, Gu believes there's potential for much longer contexts. He emphasizes that true recurrence, as found in SSMs, is necessary for potentially infinite context, although making models actually learn from and utilize such long contexts remains a challenge.

   > "One of the whole reasons that I started this entire line of work on recurrent models is that... it feels like the type of thing that should allow you to get past finite context windows."

9. **Hardware Considerations and Efficiency**

   Gu explains how the design of Mamba and Mamba 2 takes into account modern hardware capabilities, particularly the efficient use of matrix multiplications on GPUs. He discusses the concept of the "hardware lottery" and how the co-evolution of hardware and software can create challenges for new model architectures. The improvements in Mamba 2 aim to strike a balance between leveraging existing hardware optimizations and maintaining the unique benefits of SSMs.

   > "Part of me is a little reluctant to be like let's change the model so that we can make it efficient on hardware because it feels a little bit like playing into the hardware lottery... On the other hand, it's kind of inevitable because the fact is just that like you need something practical to be worthwhile."

10. **Future Directions and Open Questions**

    The podcast concludes with a discussion of potential future directions for SSM research. Gu expresses interest in developing models with multiple specialized states, which could lead to both superior performance and easier interpretability. He also mentions the possibility of more expressive SSM variants, although these would likely come with significant computational costs. The conversation highlights the ongoing need for balancing theoretical advancements with practical considerations in AI research.

    > "I had a vision for this, I have a lot of ideas... but there's still a large sense of it that's kind of intuition driven and it's coming more from the idea that like I don't have all the ideas, there's hopefully going to be plenty of smart people who are interested in this and want to work on things."

## Concise Summary

This podcast episode provides a comprehensive overview of state space models (SSMs) and the Mamba architecture, as explained by their creator, Albert Gu.

## Key Points

1. Runway's Mission and Product
   Runway aims to make business financials more understandable and accessible to everyone in a company, not just the finance team. Chen describes it as a "business operating system" rather than just a finance platform. The product integrates with numerous data sources (about 680) to provide a comprehensive view of a company's operations. Runway uses AI to explain financial concepts, generate scenarios, and make complex financial data more approachable. Chen envisions Runway as a tool that could potentially increase global GDP by enabling better business understanding and decision-making across organizations.

   > "The mission of Runway has never changed. The mission has always been to make business accessible and understandable to everyone."

2. AI Integration in Runway
   Runway incorporates AI in several ways, including an "explain mode" where users can hover over any part of the product to get an explanation, and a scenario planning feature that uses AI to generate financial projections based on user inputs. The AI is designed to work in the background, providing what Chen calls "ambient intelligence" - insights and explanations without the need for explicit user queries. However, Chen acknowledges that the AI's scenario planning capabilities are still in early stages and not entirely reliable yet.

   > "We have this thing called explain mode and what that does is when you hold down the control button and you mouse over any part of the product, it will just tell you what you're looking at and explain it."

3. Challenges in AI Implementation
   Chen discusses the challenges of implementing AI in finance, particularly in making it reliable and trustworthy. He emphasizes that their current AI implementations, especially for scenario planning, are not yet fully dependable and require human oversight.
