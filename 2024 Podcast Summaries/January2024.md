7.Practical AI https://changelog.com/practicalai/251

Daniel Whitenack: Well, Chris, one of the things that we did leading up to this conversation was take a look at dozens of these "This is what I'm predicting for AI in 2024" posts on Twitter and LinkedIn, and kind of crystallized down or distilled down some trends of what people were predicting. So I'm gonna take what I kind of distilled down from all of these posts, and I'll just put it out there, and we can comment on any of those... And then it may be interesting to look at a couple of these from specific people; that might be interesting, because a lot of people have been making these predictions.

So I did not do this with AI, but if you actually just look through the internet at these posts, you'll see some trends pop up of what people are predicting... And I think both you and I looked at these and said "Yeah, these are kind of what would be expected to be predicted based on what we've seen and the conversations we've had recently."

So the common points that were predicted by many different people across the interwebs - I put them in five categories here. So I'll just read them off, and then we can make a comment on any of them if you want. So RAG, or retrieval-augmented generation, will continue to be a focus and will experience various improvements. So that's number one. Number two, open models will beat GPT-4 in 2024. Number three, productivity in work will be enhanced by AI, rather than replaced by AI. Number four, multimodal models will be more of a focus in 2024. I actually think that was one that I predicted last year when we did our predictions, o maybe I was a year off... So there you go, I was a year off. And then number five, there'll be more focus on small language models, rather than large language models, because of economic and compute efficiency.

9.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uWnHG5E1-g The Quest for Autonomous Web Agents with Div Garg, Cofounder and CEO of MultiOn
AI Agents and Job Transformation: The episode begins with a discussion about how technology will change the nature of jobs, automating many digital chores and tasks currently performed by humans, much like how computers and typewriters transformed jobs in the past​​.
State of AI Agents: Div G mentions that after an initial wave of enthusiasm for post-GPT-4 AI agents, the field experienced a trough of disillusionment. However, Multiion continued to build and iterate their product, which, while still limited compared to human assistants, has shown impressive successes and has been made available to more users through a private beta​​.
Capabilities and Challenges: The current state of AI agents is early in terms of capabilities. A major challenge is that these agents are not trained to understand the specific environments they operate in, such as web or code environments. Humans, by contrast, learn and adapt quickly through trial and error, a feature not yet fully replicated in AI agents​​.
Future Directions and Learning: Div G expresses excitement about enabling agents to adapt and learn behaviors automatically, possibly through online learning. He discusses collaborating with academia to apply research in reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) to practical industry applications​​.

Vision and Action Steps: Vision is highlighted as a key component in enhancing AI agents. However, current vision models struggle with actions based on visual inputs, like locating coordinates from an image. Multiion aims to overcome these challenges by intelligently combining language and visual data​​.
Cost Considerations: The cost of running tasks on AI agents is measured in steps, with each step costing not more than 10 cents. Multiion strives to reduce this cost further through efficient model usage and caching strategies​​.
Customization and Use of GPT-4: Multiion uses a combination of open-source architectures and fine-tunes them for specific tasks. They also employ GPT-4 for certain functions like planning, emphasizing the adaptability of their system to different models and APIs​​.
