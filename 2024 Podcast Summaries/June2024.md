## 1. Latent Space Podcast with Mike Conover (Brightwave): Detailed Notes

**Introduction:**

Alessio Fanelli (Partner and CTO in Residence at Decibel Partners) interviews Mike Conover (Founder of Brightwave), a returning guest and AI expert, in this episode of the Latent Space Podcast.  They delve into Mike's journey from leading the open-source large language model team at Databricks to founding Brightwave, an AI-driven financial analysis platform. The conversation explores the technical challenges of building such a system, the evolving landscape of AI, and the future of financial analysis.

**Key Points:**

* **Mike's Journey to Finance:**  Mike's background might seem surprising for someone leading a financial services company. However, his work with large datasets at LinkedIn predicting market movements and his research on propaganda and network structures using Twitter data reveal a consistent focus on analyzing complex systems using digital traces.
* **Brightwave's Mission:** Brightwave aims to augment the capabilities of financial professionals by providing AI-powered insights. By processing vast amounts of financial data, the platform helps analysts develop investment theses, understand market trends, and stay ahead of the curve. 
* **Limitations of Large Context Windows:** Contrary to initial expectations, simply increasing context sizes doesn't automatically solve synthesis problems. While useful for fact retrieval, models struggle to generate in-depth analysis from massive text chunks. 
* **Systems of Systems Approach:** Brightwave employs a modular approach with specialized subsystems for tasks like temporal analysis, information retrieval, and quantitative reasoning, ensuring accurate and relevant outputs. 
* **Fact Verification and Product Design:** Addressing the issue of LLM hallucinations, Brightwave utilizes multiple passes over data, model consensus, and bespoke models to verify generated information. Additionally, product features allow users to request double-checking and provide feedback for improved accuracy. 
* **Personalization and Revealed Preferences:**  Instead of relying on explicit user input, Brightwave tracks user interactions and question chains to develop personalized profiles reflecting their investment beliefs and interests. 
* **LLM Supervision and Benchmarking:** Brightwave utilizes a combination of LLM-based evaluation, human annotation, and domain-specific heuristics to assess system performance and ensure alignment with real-world financial analysis needs. 
* **Knowledge Graphs for Enhanced Reasoning:**  Brightwave invests in knowledge graph extraction from financial documents, moving beyond semantic search to create a structured, interconnected representation of financial entities and relationships for deeper analysis.
* **Fine-tuning vs. RAG:** While acknowledging ongoing research, Mike emphasizes Brightwave's focus on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for grounded reasoning. Fine-tuning is used strategically to specialize models for specific tasks within their system. 
* **AI's Role in Financial Analysis:** Mike envisions AI as a powerful tool to augment human capabilities, not replace them. Brightwave's "partner in thought" approach enables analysts to leverage AI-generated insights and refine them with their expertise.

**Concise Summary:**

This episode explores the intersection of AI and financial analysis through the lens of Mike Conover's journey with Brightwave.  They discuss the company's mission to empower financial professionals with AI-driven insights, the technical challenges of building such a system, and the evolving role of large language models in complex domains. The conversation highlights the importance of specialized subsystems, robust fact verification, user personalization, and a nuanced understanding of AI's limitations and potential for transforming financial analysis.
