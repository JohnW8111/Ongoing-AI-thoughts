###1.This is a paper by NAM Artificial Intelligence in Health, Health Care, and Biomedical Science: An AI Code of Conduct Principles and Commitments Discussion Draft
The Draft Code of Conduct Framework presented in the document outlines a set of principles and commitments designed to guide the responsible development, implementation, and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health, healthcare, and biomedical science. Here's a more detailed look at the components of this framework:

## Code Principles
The Code Principles are foundational values derived from a comprehensive review of existing guidelines, frameworks, and principles related to AI in healthcare. They are intended to ensure that AI applications in health and medicine are developed and used in a manner that is:

- **Engaged**: Focused on understanding and prioritizing the needs, preferences, and goals of people throughout the AI lifecycle.
- **Safe**: Dedicated to continuous vigilance to avoid potentially harmful consequences of AI applications in health and medicine for individuals and population groups.
- **Effective**: Proven to achieve the intended improvements in personal health and the human condition, within ethical guidelines.
- **Equitable**: Accompanied by proof of efforts to ensure fair development and access to AI benefits and risk mitigation measures.
- **Efficient**: Associated with reduced costs for health gains, and a minimal or neutral impact on the natural environment.
- **Accessible**: Ensuring stakeholder access and engagement throughout the AI lifecycle.
- **Transparent**: Providing open and understandable information about AI components, performance, and outcomes.
- **Accountable**: Demonstrating clear benefits and accountability for adverse consequences.
- **Secure**: Ensuring privacy and security of health data as a protected resource.
- **Adaptive**: Guaranteeing ongoing evaluation and improvement in health, healthcare, and biomedical science applications.

## Code Commitments
The Code Commitments are simple, action-oriented rules derived from the core principles of a Learning Health System (LHS) and informed by Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory. They are designed to direct the application and evaluation of the Code Principles in practice across various stakeholders in the AI lifecycle:

1. **Focus**: Prioritize human health and connection.
2. **Benefits**: Ensure equitable distribution of benefits and risk.
3. **Involvement**: Engage people as partners in all stages.
4. **Workforce Well-being**: Support the moral well-being and shared purpose of the healthcare workforce.
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor and share AI performance and impact transparently.
6. **Innovation**: Foster innovation, adoption, collaborative learning, and continuous improvement.

These commitments are intended to serve as a foundation for translating the principles into tailored implementation plans, facilitating collective progress towards the safe, effective, ethical, equitable, reliable, and responsible use of AI in health sectors.

The Draft Code of Conduct Framework represents a significant effort to address the complex challenges and opportunities presented by AI in healthcare. It emphasizes the need for a harmonized set of principles and commitments, informed by previous work and adapted to the unique needs of health, healthcare, and biomedical science. The framework aims to promote trustworthiness in health AI by providing a basis for governance, testing, validation, and continual improvement as technology and insights advance.
